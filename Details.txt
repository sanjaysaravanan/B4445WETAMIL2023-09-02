Code/Folder Structure:
    Separate the Core Business Logic/ APIs and DB Communication:

      Grouping of apis with /<path-name>

      /movies ---> CRUD on movies
      /users ---> CRUD on users
      /theaters ---> CRUD on theaters
      /booking ---> CRUD on theaters

Authentication & Authorization:

  Authentication Flow:
    User Register or Login to a Application:
      1. Write API for register and register should create a user in the DB
      2. Write API for login and login should create a new jwt token along with user details and return to FE
      3. So, APIs /register and /login will be public and accessible by public
  
  Authorization Flow:
    Application flow after successfull login:
      1. use the token from the login response
      2. APIs except /login, /register, read movies API should contain the request header 
         authorization/acesstoken: < jwt-token >
      3. backend will use this token to verify the roles or access or permission of the user in backend

FE:
  Authentication:
    Login/Register Pages
    Only these two pages should be accessible before login
    trying to access any other page should direct back to the login page
  Authorization:
    1. Login API will return a token & role, use that token as a identifier 
    for the login status,
    2. use local storage to store the token
      then restrict the user access with role

CSS Transitions:
  @keyframs and transform funcs ( skew, scal, translate, rotate )


Next Session:
  Authorization for API and FE Pages using simple roles concept
